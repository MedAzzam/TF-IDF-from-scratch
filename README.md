# TF-IDF-from-scratch
The "TF-IDF from scratch" project is an educational exercise aimed at understanding and implementing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm without relying on existing libraries.

This project offers a Python implementation of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm without relying on external libraries. TF-IDF is a technique widely used in natural language processing and information retrieval to measure the importance of terms in documents.

## Features

- Calculate Term Frequency (TF) within individual documents.
- Compute Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) across a collection of documents.
- Calculate TF-IDF scores for terms in documents.
- Includes sample datasets for demonstration purposes.
